            Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve in 2013. It serves as a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos by Blizzard Entertainment.
            
            The game features two teams of five players competing in matches. Each team occupies and defends its own base on the map. Players control unique characters called heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles. Throughout the match, players earn experience points (XP) and collect items to enhance their heroes. The core objective is to destroy the opposing team's Ancient, a heavily fortified structure located at the heart of their base, while preventing the enemy from doing the same. Victory is achieved when a team's Ancient is destroyed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2">for more info click here</a> </p>
