    <h1>Hello, My Name is Karl De Guzman</h1>

    <p> Hi, I am Karl De Guzman, a Computer Science student from the Philippines. I am passionate about becoming a Data Analyst and doing Project Management.
        I love helping people understand coding and data handling. Currently, I am involved in various projects, including working in the Admissions area 
        of the Ho'okele Department as an SIS Project Support Representative, serving as the second counselor in the Elders Quorum Presidency, and being part
        of the Workday integration project. In addition to my studies, I am also working 
        to fund my education and learning to achieve my goals and dream.</p>

     <p> I love spending time with my love ones. My family is the best thing that ever happened in my life. I am so grateful for their support and their love to me.
        I also love serving in the temple twice a week. I love seeing the amazing faces and joy of people who and worship in the temple.
        </p>
