    <p id = 'first'>As a brief summary, <span class="emp"> Dota 2 or Defense of the Ancient 2 </span>is a popular online multiplayer battle game where two teams of five players each compete to destroy the other team's base, called the "Ancient." Each player controls a  character, known as a hero, with an abilities and a roles to be usefull for a team. The game map is divided 
        into three lanes (top, middle, and bottom) and a jungle area. Players earn gold and experience by defeating enemy heroes, minions (creeps), and neutral monsters. This helps them level up their heroes and buy powerful items to become stronger as the game progresses. I 've loved playing Dota 2 ever since I was kid. I spent a majority of my day everyday playing this game. I was able to make a lot of friends and good memories through this game.</p>

        <p>Teamwork, strategy, and communication are key in Dota 2, as each team must coordinate attacks, defend their base, and control important objectives. The goal is to outplay the opposing team, pushing through their defenses and ultimately destroying their Ancient. I guess we  can relate this in our life where we need teamwork in our daily task. </p>
