<p class="green">Topias "Topson" Taavitsainen is a Dota professional player that I love to watch. I fell in love with his playstyle and his knowledge with the game. I love his decision and play making skill with the game. I love watching him play every day whenever there is a tournament available in the world. Recently, the biggest Dota 2 tournament which is "The International" took place in america. Topson and his team were having a good run but fell short in the lower bracket finals, losing to Gaimin Gladiators. Finishing a 3rd in the whole tournament.</p>
